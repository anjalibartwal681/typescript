Implicit type conversion, also known as type coercion, occurs automatically by the JavaScript engine during certain operations. It involves the conversion of one data type to another without the programmer explicitly requesting the conversion. This often happens in situations where different data types are involved in operations.

Example of implicit type conversion:


Copy code
let num = 5;
let str = "10";

let result = num + str;
console.log(result);

Implicit Type Conversion (Type Coercion):

Implicit type conversion, also known as type coercion, occurs automatically by the JavaScript engine during certain operations. It involves the conversion of one data type to another without the programmer explicitly requesting the conversion. This often happens in situations where different data types are involved in operations.

Example of implicit type conversion:

javascript
Copy code
let num = 5;
let str = "10";

let result = num + str;
console.log(result); // Outputs: "510" (string concatenation, implicit conversion of 'num' to a string)
In this example, the numeric value num is implicitly converted to a string to perform the concatenation with the string str.

**************************************************************************Explicit Type Conversion:************************************************************************************************

Explicit type conversion, also known as type casting, occurs when the programmer explicitly specifies the desired data type conversion. This is done using built-in functions or operators provided by the programming language.

Example of explicit type conversion in JavaScript:


let str = "10";
let num = Number(str);

console.log(num); // Outputs: 10 (explicit conversion of 'str' to a number
