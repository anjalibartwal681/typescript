TypeScript is  a strictly typed language. 
  Strict typing means that variables, parameters, and other elements in the code must be declared with a specific data type, 
  and the TypeScript compiler enforces these types during the compilation process.
  While TypeScript does support type inference (the ability to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its initial value), 
  it still enforces strict typing to catch type-related errors and improve code reliability.
  Strict typing is one of the key features that distinguishes TypeScript from regular JavaScript.
