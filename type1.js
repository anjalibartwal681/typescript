TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language.
  It is developed and maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript code,
  which means that it can run on any JavaScript runtime environment. The key features of TypeScript include:

Static Typing:
TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript, 
  allowing developers to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values.
  This helps catch type-related errors during development, providing better tooling and code intelligence.

Type Annotations:
Developers can use type annotations to explicitly specify the data types of variables, 
  function parameters, and return types. 
  This makes the code more self-documenting and helps IDEs provide better code completion and error checking.
